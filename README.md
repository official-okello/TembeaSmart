- Applies TF-IDF on destination/activity descriptions and cosine similarity to find relevant matches.

### 🔍 Clustering Traveler Types (Future)
- KMeans or DBSCAN to group travelers (e.g., luxury, backpacker, family) and improve personalization.

### 📈 Itinerary Optimization (Optional)
- Greedy algorithm or A* heuristic to suggest efficient travel routes within time and cost limits.
